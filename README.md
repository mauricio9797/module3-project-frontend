<h1 align="center">"Too Lazy to Type" Project - Frontend</h1>

<p align="center">
  Welcome to the front-end repository of the <em>"Too Lazy to Type"</em> project. This repository contains the client-side code for the website called <em>"Too Lazy to Type"</em>, which is part of the Final Project for Ironhack Bootcamp by Zuzana & Mauricio.
</p>

## Project Description

"Too Lazy to Type" is a web application that allows users to perform various tasks using voice commands, audio recordings, and text input. The frontend is built using modern web technologies such as React.js, HTML, and CSS. It communicates with the backend, which provides a RESTful API to interact with the data. The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/zuzmoskvic/module3-project-backend).

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

The frontend development server should now be running, and you can access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple structure:

- `public/`: Contains the index.html file and other static assets.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the React application.
- `config/`: Configuration or URL handling when calling to back-end.
- `components/`: Holds reusable React components used throughout the application.
- `api/`: Handles API requests to the backend server.
- `img/`: Stores images used in the application.
- `App.js`: The main component that renders the application layout and handles routing.
- `index.js`: Entry point of the application, where it is initialized.
